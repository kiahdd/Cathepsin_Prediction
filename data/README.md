# Drug Design Data Resource Grand Challenge 4 Dataset: CathepsinS

The cathepsins constitute an 11-member family of proteases involved in protein degradation. Cathepsin S is highly expressed in antigen-presenting cells, where it degrades major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II)-associated invariant chain. CatS is a candidate target for regulating immune hyper-responsiveness, as the inhibition of CatS may limit antigen presentation. This data set comprises a follow-on challenge to GC3, consisting of non-peptidic, non-covalent, small molecule inhibitors across a three order of magnitude range (nM to Î¼M) of IC50s for CatS. Specifically, we provide 459 CatS inhibitors for affinity prediction, and 39 molecules for free energy prediction. This dataset was kindly donated by Janssen. Please note the affinity values from this set were measured against a C25S CatS mutant.
