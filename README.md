Affinity Prediction of Chemical Inhibitors of Cathepsin S, a Therapeutic Target in Cancer Treatment. 

=======
# Cathepsin_Prediction
Implemented ML models (LR, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbours, Random Forest) in Python to predict binding affinities of chemical inhibitors of Cathepsin S enzyme from their 2D structural data (SMILES). A max model accuracy of 46% concluded that 2D structural data is insufficient to predict the complex kinetics of binding.
