## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

TThe code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.* & RDKit.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose to use the experimental log P data released in the paper: Large, chemically diverse dataset of log P measurements for benchmarking studies? by Martel et al: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejps.2012.10.019.

As a scientist,  it would be quite interesting to apply data analysis skills here. 

My key interests would be:

Q1: What are are options for log P prediction are based on physical descriptors, such as atom type counts, or polar surface area, or on topological descriptors?
Q2: What's the log P distribution like? How is it related to drug likeliness?
Q3: How is molecular descriptor have effect on log P? Can we predict log P based on molecular descriptor set?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Data.csv contains molecules compoubds with their log P and pH.

There is also a notebook available here to showcsae all my work related to my three questions.



## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the [post](https://medium.com/@prashantkbio/use-machine-learning-to-solve-problems-in-chemistry-dcb9491450c?sk=68d9afe416ed9ed3b3db2527eeafa1a2) available
